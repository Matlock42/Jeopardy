## Gameplay Instructions

The game works simple enough. The main prompt shows a list of categories
and questions. If a question has already been played the dollar amount
is replaced with dashes (----). To select a question for play type in the
column number (1-5) followed directly by the question value (1-5). 
>  Ex. - to play the second column $500 question type "25" and press Enter.

Then, you will see the question followed by the answer prompt. Select your
choice from the list to see if you are correct. Your score will add up
on the main prompt.

When the game is over, you will be prompted to play another round.
